# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction
The classification goal of this project is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset included over 3,000 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors.
